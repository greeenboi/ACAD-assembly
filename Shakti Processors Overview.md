# Intro to Architecture

ISA ( Instruction Set Architecture )
![[Pasted image 20250318230641.png]]
> Consists of compiler assembler linker and loader. used to process and execute high to machine level code.

| Micro Processor                        | Micro Controller                                                  |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Contains only the CPU                  | Contains the CPU and memory( like flash memory )                  |
| General Purpose                        | Specific Purposes                                                 |
| Used for high end and complex systems. | Used in Low end and Low power applications                        |
| Eg. Desktops, Mobiles, etc             | Eg. Iot Devices, Small devices like mp3 players, smart fridge etc |
| Eg. x86, ARM                           | Eg. 8051, PIC                                                     |

##### Processor Variants
● Pipelined Processors/Non pipelined processors
● In-order/Out-of-order Processors.
● Scaler / Superscaler processors
● Vector processors
● Multicore processors.
● Multithreaded processors.
